                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>This project utilized the WordPress Content Management System and WP Professional Best Practices
                        to create a website to meet the business needs for a marketing company that had outgrown its
                        existing basic site. After importing the client’s database and files, a common software
                        development methodology called Agile Development was used, working in sprints with the robust
                        CMS to develop the features, maintaining cohesive design and then launching the changes without
                        altering any original files.

                    <br>
                    <p>Alongside using Agile Methodology, the work entailed experience editing and updating existing
                        websites
                        and dynamic web applications. After obtaining an exact copy of the client’s live site, I created
                        a copy on my local server to edit. Edits included creation of a Child Theme, Advanced Theme
                        Customizations, Professional Deployment & Workflow, and using MySQL database management system,
                        the Command Line and Git version control, delivering on requests to add specific features and
                        functionality.

                <div class="col-lg-10">
                    <p>The Accelerate Marketing agency had a site created, but it was much too simple to meet their
                        business needs, as it only consisted of a basic homepage and a blog. The chief marketing officer
                        wanted a more dynamic website with key features, including a services section, social marketing
                        integrations, a new look, and other additional functionality. The edits requested were to be
                        made
                        without editing any of the existing files.

                    <p>Child Theme creation. In order to edit the files and make changes without actually altering any
                        of the original files, I created a child theme to make my modifications. The child theme
                        inherited styles and functionality from the company’s original parent theme, and only needed to
                        include the files found in the parent theme to be altered or additional templates to be added.
                        This method allowed me to customize the existing theme without directly editing its files and
                        also sped up the development process, opposed to starting something from scratch.

                    <h4>Foundation of UX</h4>
                    <p>IA is the structural plan for building a user-friendly experience, organizing, labeling, and
                        arranging site content. The method explores and guides site structures like the sitemap,
                        navigation and labeling of the site, providing a foundation for the user experience, and is
                        actually designed for both human users and computer search engines. I chose the classic
                        hierarchical IA model as the boilerplate to build an improved site structure. The IA model
                        defines the relationship between other parts of the site and informs the sitemap, starting with
                        the homepage, then the main pages, ranked by importance and organized based on the user’s needs.

                    designs and prototyping solutions. UX theory, research and data determine which pages to include for

                <h4>Sitemap and Content Organization</h4>
                <p>Implementing the hierarchical IA model and a redesigned primary navigation would make the site
                    user-focused, offering features like easier access to booking, a more efficient reservation process,
                    and a more user friendly site navigation. Sitemaps show the site scope and number of pages, how the
                    navigation links to
                    pages and how they link to each other, and the order in which people see content.
                    An improved nav would have a more prominent booking link that the user didn’t have to
                    search for, and would better organize, clarify, and prioritize site content users are
                    seeking.

                            took all the content topics City Cycles wanted to include on their website, and sorted them
                            into main page categories in a way that made sense. There were some content topics that I
                            placed onto the blog posts page, but I included the primary and secondary topics in the new
                            sitemap version. I placed the social links and some basic contact information into the
                            footer, and I relocated the reservation button to a prominent static location within the
                            header so that it is accessible from any page on the site. Also, the City Cycles logo will
                            link back to the home page from any of the site pages.

                <p>In the planning phase of the site design, user flows help to better grasp the options to
                    provide the
                    users with and to assist in delivering a product that meets their needs. They help
                    anticipate what steps
                    users will take so that potential problems can be caught before designing begins.
                    The user flow is a flowchart-style visual outline of what the users see, do, and experience
                    during a
                    specific process while using the site, and they focus on a specific task at hand. They show the
                    screens a
                    user could see from one point to the next, and map out how they might get there, and the
                    possible detours
                    using flow chart-like elements.

                    <p>Walking through the user flow of the existing City Cycles website, it quickly became clear
                        there was room
                        for improvement. Review of user interaction data confirmed this. I created a new user flow,
                        implementing
                        my own design ideas to improve the reservation process.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also worked through prioritizing content for mobile first development by identifying top
                        features to include on mobile versions, which include contact details, bicycle reservation form
                        link, and the location and hours. With the structure in place, I was ready to progress with the
                        design
                        beginning with paper wireframes, to a static mockup, to a digital draft of the site, adding more
                        detail and elements to finally a clickable prototype users can interact with like a real
                        website.

            <h3>Design Theory</h3>
            <br>

            <p>So far I’ve been using data to help qualify decisions throughout the research and design process. The
                collection
                of fundamental guidelines called design theory involves incorporating visual design elements
                such as line, color, value, texture, form, and space, and design principles like size,
                emphasis, balance, contrast and how the elements communicate to the user.
                Particularly here I evaluated the design of the search bar on the City Cycles website, then
                prescribed a potential solution using design theory.
            </p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>City Cycles site users were struggling to find the search bar when they needed it and they were
                        having difficulty using the main site navigation in general, causing a lot of confusion.
                        Following the design principle of emphasis I decided to make the search bar, a really important
                        link, bigger and more prominent and I also incorporated some contrast to boost the
                        user-friendliness
                        of this aspect of the website.

            <h4>Design Patterns</h4>
            <p>I explored industry standard design patterns, layouts, and time-saving UX tools and decided some of the
                most helpful patterns for the City Cycles website would be the addition of guided steps throughout the
                registration process, as well as a home link to transport the user directly to the home page from the
                logo. Another design pattern I would recommend for the site is form feedback to complete a
                required component of a form, along with form hints in the fields.

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>To the low fidelity digital mockups I added styling and design elements, and began prototyping to
                        simulate the user’s experience of the site in order to test and refine it before launching.
                        Reviewing the user flow was a good starting point for the prototypes because it helped to
                        visualize each page the user sees, giving an idea of what pages and visual elements needed to be
                        included in the prototype.

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>For effective UX testing, the high-fidelity or “hi-fi” prototype should closely match the look
                        and functionality of the real site, immersing users in the experience of using the site so they
                        can provide quality feedback on it. The design platform I used to create the hi-fi interactive
                        prototype was the industry-standard InVision digital prototyping tool. Users can interact with
                        the clickable prototype like a real website.

            <h3>Advocating for UX</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Implementing UX research ensures getting the solution right the first time, thereby reducing the risk and
                cost of failure, since testing is performed before launching a product. It’s easier to fix a prototype
                than it is to fix an entire custom-coded website, saving time, money, and risk to a company. UX research
                means standing up for your user, and backing up your recommendations with data and facts. Feedback can
                be implemented through iterative design improvements strategically based on user findings.
