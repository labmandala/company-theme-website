                        that are produced sustainably and ethically. Yolanda has designed four chairs so far, and feels
                        it’s the right time to launch her website. She needs someone to design a website to showcase her
                        new chair designs and allow customers to start pre-ordering them.

                        Conmigo chair is made with only sustainable, fair-trade materials. We’re also committed to

                        fair labor practices that ensure our employees have safe working conditions and are paid fairly

                        their skills. The result is a chair that you’ll not only love in your home or office but a chair
                        that was lovingly made by the person building it.

                    <h3>Research & Client Intake</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The target audience for the chairs strongly value sustainability as well as eco- and
                        ethically-produced goods. The client wants to ensure that her stylish chair designs entice
                        orders, but it's also important that the mission to support fair trade and fair labor resonates
                        with potential customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many of the competitors are big-box retailers (like IKEA) who often focus on either sustainably
                        sourced materials or fair labor. Sit Conmigo is unique in the furniture marketplace because they
                        focus on BOTH the source of materials and ethically building their chairs with fair labor.

                    <h3>Mobile First Approach</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Designing an online experience for mobile screens first, before designing it for larger screen
                        sizes, includes two steps: prioritizing the absolute must-have information and maximizing the
                        space on the mobile screen. This user friendly approach gives users the most important
                        information they’re looking for right away, without having to search for it. Progressive
                        enhancement meant building the smaller, mobile version first including essential features and
                        functions, then later expanding the design to larger and more advanced tablet and desktop
                        versions for optimal user experience. </p>
                    <br>
                </div>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The main challenge was in fitting all the content, information and design ideas into a small
                        space. Considering the main goals from the project brief, as well as additional client requests,
                        I was able to prioritize the most important content and position design requirements into the
                        layout accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Using condensed content and visual hierarchy, the mobile design uses a collapsed menu in the
                        corner, which upon clicking reveals a dropdown of the full navigation menu. That way, the
                        navigation keeps its importance, takes up less space, and makes room for other high-priority
                        content.

                    <p>The digital wireframes began as low fidelity structures from the sketch. Using a method to help
                        neatly align the content and elements for a visually appealing layout, I applied a twelve-column
                        grid system to my design for positioning and alignment of content within that framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>After examining some common design layouts, I decided to go with the Featured Image style of
                        layout. This
                        way, Dorothy’s work would be front and center right from the start for a compelling
                        introduction,
                        emphasizing her photography. I would include her logo and full name at the top for instant
                        branding and
                        identity, as well as her Artist’s Statement in the top header section as prioritized content
                        about her.

                    <h4>Typography</h4>
                    <p>Color can be a powerful design element of the storytelling process, communicating messages,
                        eliciting feelings, and assisting in creating visual hierarchy. After exploring color theory and
                        various color relationships, I played with hue, saturation, and value, as well as contrast. I
                        settled on a magenta hue for a powerful splash of boldness with a feminine edge. Outside of
                        black and white, I stuck to a three-color scheme for this project to create visual interest and
                        variety without becoming busy or distracting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Next was selecting typography and using it establish visual hierarchy, ensuring it expressed tone
                        and mood, and complemented the overall design. I experimented with different font-pairings on
                        digital artboards before deciding on the main typefaces for Dorothy’s style tile, keeping in
                        line with her style and goals. I created a custom typescale as a guide for all the sizes,
                        typefaces, and transformations throughout the site.
