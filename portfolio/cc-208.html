                        existing bike rentals company website. The objective is to enhance the site navigation and
                        reservation feature, making the interaction with the online process more user friendly and
                        easier to use, ultimately increasing the online reservation rate. This project is an
                        expansion of my <a href="cc-re.html">City Cycles UX Research Case Study</a>.

                    <p>Plan and organize site content structure in line with information architecture best practices to
                        create a clickable, digital prototype. This involved building a new user-friendly structure
                        using universal design principles and iterative design from low fidelity wireframing and task
                        flows based around user requirements, to high fidelity mockups and interactive prototyping, as
                        well as further user testing and feedback.

                    <p>Rentals have been diminishing and the research suggested the lack of online reservations was
                        related to the inefficient website user interface and lack of user centered design within
                        the
                        online booking process. There was customer confusion with back and forth emailing and they
                        were
                        inevitably contacting or visiting the shop in person to complete the reservation process,
                        impacting customer service.

                        organized based on the user’s needs. IA is designed fro both people and search engines.

                            find what they’re looking for, and accomplish what they intend to do. Part of this involves
                            organizing things in intuitive ways using a process called content strategy, as well as
                            creation

            <h3>Inclusive Design</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Improving usability meant making a quality design that is intuitive and easy for users to learn and
                use.
                Accessibility meant being mindful of users with limitations or disabilities. For example, ensuring
                there is enough visual contrast for colorblind users. Universal design philosophy and practice takes
                all
                users
                into consideration from the start, including users with different levels of ability.
            </p>

            <p>Clear labels help human users, screen readers, and search engines, while a clean, readable font with
                adequate
                contrast against the background and careful imagery contribute to inclusive design. After
                implementing universal design
                features, trunk testing could be performed as a strategy for determining how easy it was to use and
                to
                navigate.

                <h4>Sitemap and Content Organization</h4>
                <p>Implementing the IA model and a redesigned primary navigation would make it user-focused,
                    offering features like easier access to booking, an efficient reservation process, and
                    user-friendly
                    site navigation. Sitemaps show the site scope and number of pages, how the navigation links
                    to
                    pages and how pages they link to each other, and the order in which people see content.
                    An improved nav would have a more prominent booking link that the user didn’t have to
                    search for, and would better organize, clarify, and prioritize site content users are
                    seeking.
                </p>

                <p>An card sorting exercise was used to discover how to best organize the content on the site in ways
                    that
                    are intuitive to the end user. This is where I took all the content topics City Cycles wanted to
                    include
                    on their website and sorted them into main page categories in a structure that made sense.

                            users with and to assist in delivering a product that meets their needs. They help
                            anticipate what steps
                            users will take so that potential problems can be caught before designing begins.

                            for improvement. Review of user interaction data confirmed this. I created a new user flow,

                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>So far I’ve been using data to help qualify decisions throughout the process. The collection
                        of fundamental guidelines called design theory involves incorporating visual design elements
                        such as line, color, value, texture, form, and space, and design principles like size,
                        emphasis, balance, contrast and how the elements communicate to the user.

                <div class="col-lg-5">
                    <p>Particularly here I evaluated the design of the search bar on the City Cycles website, then
                        prescribed a potential solution to boost the user-friendliness of by make the search bar, a
                        really important link, bigger and more prominent, and following the design principle of
                        emphasis.

            <h4>Design Patterns</h4>
            <p>I explored industry standard design patterns, layouts, and time-saving UX tools and decided some of the
                most helpful patterns for the City Cycles website would be the addition of guided steps throughout the
                registration process, as well as a home link to transport the user directly to the home page from the
                logo. Another design pattern I would recommend for the site is form feedback giving a user to complete a
                required component of a form, along with form hints.

            <h3>UX Recommendations</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Based on the UX research data, I recommend that City Cycles modify their homepage, including the
                navigation menu and reservation button, to clarify their message and purpose for users visiting
                their
                site. The reservation process needs to be improved so that it’s easier to use and more efficient,
                offering users a positive experience, so they will opt to reserve online instead of calling in, and
                will
                even want to return as a customer. The online feature should offer convenience for the customer to
                obtain a bike rental.

                        <li>Ensure the homepage reservation button is clear and prominent on the page.</li>
                        <li>Redesign the navigation menu to clarify and prioritize site purpose and content.</li>
                        <li>Implement a simple and efficient 3 or 4 step online reservation process.</li>
                        <li>Provide a prompt confirmation upon completion of successful reservation.</li>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As a continuation of this UX research project, my focus will shift into the realms of design,
                utilizing
                the tools, skills and fundamentals of information architectture, digital prototyping, wireframing,
                usability and universal design to create a high fidelity clickable prototype of a redesigned,
                UX-friendly City Cycles website.
